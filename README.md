# EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT SYSTEM (ERS)-TA

## Project Description

This project showcases an Employee Reimbursement System where employees will be able to login to their accounts and submit reimbursement requests to the management team. Employees must have a username and password. The system will have a validation system. Once an employee submits a reimbursement request in the system, a manager may log in and view all an employees reimbursement requests. A manager may also approve or reject reimbursement requests. Employees have the ability to go to their homepage, view their information, update their information, view their pending reimbursement requests,and logout.
